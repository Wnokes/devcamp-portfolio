        <p> I have been actively learning and practicing software development for a total of 4 years now. I am very passionate about technology and eager to learn all I can about programming and other tech skills.</p>

        <p> For years my programing focus was in the gaming world, building simple computer and phone games as a hobby. Recently however I decided to take it to the next step and enroll in Bottega Tech. There I was able to learn many new skills and talents. Going forward I plan to continue learning and developing new skills.</p>

        <p> I am now excited to build high quality products for my clients and develop lasting business relationships. Whether it is Mobile Apps, Interactive Websites, or any other programing need, I look forward to working with you. </p>
